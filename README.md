# Restaurant Score Service 


## Getting Started

This project uses Python 3.7.

### Developer Environment Setup

Create a virtualenv using the Python [venv module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [pew](https://github.com/berdario/pew) (*P*ython *E*nvironment *W*rapper):

```
# Using venv
python -m venv venv

# The virtualenv won't be activated by default so activate it with:
. venv/bin/activate
```

Now install all dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To deactivate the virtualenv:

```
# Using venv
deactivate
```

Kubernetes Environment for DB

```
# Perference minikube
minikube start
```
### PyCharm

If using PyCharm, configure the project with the following:

- Preferences > Tools > Python Integrated Tools
  - Package requirements file: `requirements.txt`


## Deployment and use

### DB setup
Setting up DB [POSTGRES]
```
# start postgress in kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres/postgres_wl.yaml
```

Setting up DB [PGADMIN]
```
# start postgress in kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/pgadmin/pgadmin_wl.yaml
```
### RestAPI setup
Set PYTHONPATH
```
# absolute resturant folder path
# linux
export=~/Restaurant/

# windows
set PYTHONPATH=D:\Restaurant\
```
Update constant variable
 ```
USER = "postgres"
PASSWORD = "root"
HOST = <DB server IP>
PORT = "30432" 
```

### Start RestAPI
Update constant variable
 ```
Restaurant/rest_api/app.py
```
### Create table
To create table and insert sample data run script
```
python Restaurant/script/db_table.py
```
#### Run Unit Tests

Run all unit tests.

```
\Restaurant>pytest "scripts\unit_test" -v
```

   ## Design
   ###Architectural and design choices you made for writing this code and the reasoning for these.
   Architecture
   ```
    APP->RestAPI<->[client]<->[DB server]
   ```
   Package/APP choice
   ```
   Postgres: Postgres a free and open-source relational database management system 
        emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance

   Flask: Flask is a popular micro framework for building web applications.
       Since it is a micro-framework, it is very easy to use and lacks most
       of the advanced functionality which is found in a full-fledged framework. 
       Therefore, building a REST API in Flask is very simple.

   psycopg2: python package to connect postgres db
   ```

   ## Trade-offs
   ### Leftout and additional code
   Leftout
   ```
    Multiple unittest/test scenarios are missed out 

   ```
   Additional code
   ```
    Multiple unittest to get maximum code coverage 
    increse RestAPI calls

   ```
   ## 3rd party Code
   ###Code which does not belong to me
   ```
   Kubernetes code for postgres and pgadmin is from net
   ```
